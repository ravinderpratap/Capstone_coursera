## Introduction

This Presentation is created to pitch an Application build to predict the **Next Word** while typing through Keyboard. This application built as part of the final Capstone Project for Coursera Data Science certification offered in collaboration with John Hopkins University.

### **Goal of Project:**

Goal of project is to build Predictive Model for English Language text. Skills Required for building Predictive Model:

- Natural Language Processing.
- Text Mining.
- Data Exploration, Loading and Cleaning of Data.
- Shiny App Building Skills.

## Input Dataset Details

Source Data for Project is found @ <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip>

- Dataset contains the Text files recorded From US News, Blogs websites and Tweets from Twitter.
- It has Text files from English, German and French Language.
- <span style="color:blue">*We have built a Model only for English Language* </span>

This Data set is provided by the SwiftKey Company for developing the text prediction model.

## Text Prediction Model Approach

Following steps are performed to Build an Text Prediction App:

- **Text Mining** : All Files are read and taken a subtastantial subset of those files. Clubbed together for Text Analysis.
- Removed Profanities i.e. Bad Words.
- Remove Whitespaces, punctuation and numbers to Clean it up.
- **Tokenization** : Tokenizing the data by creating 1-Gram, 2-Gram, 3-Gram, 4-Gram Datasets capturing the frequency of word combination occurrances.
- Use N-Gram | N-1 Gram, **Back-Off** Model technique along with N-Gram Models to Predict the Next Word.
